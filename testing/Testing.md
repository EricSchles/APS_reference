#Testing

##Intro

Testing is a combination of checking for performance and checking for correctness.  How you handle both will determine whether or not your programs will pass - both in programming competition and in a production environment - which is why they are the criteria that matter.

##How to do testing

I personally believe testing should be done by a scripting language so I'll be handing you some premade python scripts to do this.

If you need to install python check out:

* [python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [python installation guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* [pip install page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
* [anaconda install page - all the scientific computing you'll need](http://continuum.io/downloads)

Of course - you are welcome to write your own testing software in Java (it's good practice).  Since python reads more or less like psuedo code the translation should be obvious.  If you have any issues, please feel free to stop by office hours.

##Performance

There are a few ways to measure performance - the actual running time of the program, the Big-Oh time of the program.  Both are important since you will be dealing with variable sized input.  

Checkout a profiler.py to see how running time analysis is done.

A brief review of Big-Oh analysis follows below:
